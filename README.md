# Wasecurity
Desktop app that saves residents and visitors information and keeps record of when a visitor comes.

# How it works

The security guard asks the visitor to what apartment is he going, then he searchs for the apartment in the main form and check if that visitor and his vehicle are registered in the database; if he does, he registers the visitor's entrance by selecting his name and clicking "registrar", if the visitor or his vehicle aren't registered, the security guard can add him using the menu on top.
